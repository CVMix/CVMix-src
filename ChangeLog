Tag Summary: Inclusion of double-diffusion mixing, fixed support for building
             with the PGI compiler, and a couple of other small make system
             bug fixes.

Tag Name:    cvmix_20130214
Tag Summary: Improvements to src/shared/Makefile; can now call the Makefile
             from any directory and the recursion works properly (so nothing
             gets written to src/shared/ unless you want it to). This is the
             tag I am going to hardcode into my POP branch because POP can
             now call this Makefile remotely rather than building CVMix into
             CESM's libocn.a.

Tag Name:    cvmix_20130213
Tag Summary: This is an enormous change from the last tag.

             1) a shear mixing module (supporting PP and the shear mixing from
             KPP) has been created, as well as place-holders for tidal mixing
             and double diffusion mixing. Secondly, the build-system has been
             restructured again: the modules in src/shared can be built into
             a stand-alone library, and the CVMix 1D driver now links to the
             library. Also, the 1D driver is a single executable, with the
             old driver programs now called as subroutines.

             2) The output routines have also been updated -- the 1D driver can
             now specify what variables should be output, so all the drivers
             call the same cvmix_write() subroutine.

             3) Added support for more compilers -- CVMix now supports (and has
             been tested with) the GNU, Intel, PGI, IBM, and NAG compilers. As
             of this tag, all compilers build without warnings.

             4) Steve Griffies added his manual to the repository, it is still
             a work in progress. It can be found in manual/.

             5) Minor changes include lots of renaming (the vmix_* files are
             now cvmix_*, as are all the variables in cvmix_kinds_and_types)
             and reorganizing directories. The libcvmix.a library is built into
             lib/, the .mod files needed are in include/, and the executable
             for the 1D driver gets built into bin/. The bld/ directory looks
             a little different as well; the main Makefile has been refactored
             (and moved to src/) to allow code reuse with the Makefile in
             src/shared/. The CompileFlags.mak file contains all the compiler-
             specific flags.

Tag Date:    30 Sep 2012
Tag Name:    cvmix_20120930
Tag Summary: A lot of restructuring / one new feature. The executable is now
             build in $CVMix/bld/exe/ instead of $CVMix/exe/; there are now
             multiple stand-alone drivers, and you must specify which one to
             use when you build the code. All the *.o and *.mod files are put
             in $CVMix/bld/obj/, rather than the .o files in $CVMix/bld/ and
             the .mod files in whatever directory you ran `make` from. If you
             have protex installed, you can generate the in-source protex
             documentation by running `$CVMix/doc/make_protex_file`. I also
             deleted the $CVMix/ncl/ directory in favor of keeping the ncl
             files in the reg_tests/ subdirectory that actually calls them.

             Feature: vmix_output.F90 now handles outputting data to disk, and
             both stand-alone drivers use the vmix_output routines. At present,
             can output either netCDF or ascii; the netCDF writing routines need
             error checking / better interfaces (currently only write the
             diffusivity coefficient, no check to see what dimensions were
             previously defined).

             Minor changes: updated the svn:keywords property on the source
             code to include Id and URL. Also updated svn:ignore on $CVMix/bld
             to account for moving the .o and .mod files into $CVMix/bld/obj.

Tag Name:    cvmix_20120913
Tag Summary: Started repository for stand-alone CVMix. This tag is the first
             to use pointers rather than allocatable arrays for the mixing
             coefficients / column parameters (depth, interface depth, etc).
             This is also the first tag that uses $CVMix/bld/setup (a python
             script) to store environment variables needed for the build.

             Minor changes: updated the svn:ignore property on a couple of
             directories to ignore the CVMix executable, .o and .mod files,
             and any graphics output from the NCL scripts.
