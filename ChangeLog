Tag Name:    cvmix_201209??
Tag Summary: A lot of restructuring / one new feature. The executable is now
             build in $CVMix/bld/exe/ instead of $CVMix/exe/; there are now
             multiple stand-alone drivers, and you must specify which one to
             use when you build the code. All the *.o and *.mod files are put
             in $CVMix/bld/obj/, rather than the .o files in $CVMix/bld/ and
             the .mod files in whatever directory you ran `make` from. If you
             have protex installed, you can generate the in-source protex
             documentation by running `$CVMix/doc/make_protex_file`. I also
             deleted the $CVMix/ncl/ directory in favor of keeping the ncl
             files in the reg_tests/ subdirectory that actually calls them.

             Feature: vmix_output.F90 now handles outputting data to disk, and
             both stand-alone drivers use the vmix_output routines. At present,
             can output either netCDF or ascii; the netCDF writing routines need
             error checking / better interfaces (currently only write the
             diffusivity coefficient, no check to see what dimensions were
             previously defined).

             Minor changes: updated the svn:keywords property on the source
             code to include Id and URL. Also updated svn:ignore on $CVMix/bld
             to account for moving the .o and .mod files into $CVMix/bld/obj.

Tag Summary: Started repository for stand-alone CVMix. This tag is the first
             to use pointers rather than allocatable arrays for the mixing
             coefficients / column parameters (depth, interface depth, etc).
             This is also the first tag that uses $CVMix/bld/setup (a python
             script) to store environment variables needed for the build.

             Minor changes: updated the svn:ignore property on a couple of
             directories to ignore the CVMix executable, .o and .mod files,
             and any graphics output from the NCL scripts.
