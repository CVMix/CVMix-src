Right now, the stand-alone driver isn't very powerful. It is set up to run
Bryan-Lewis mixing on a single column, and output the diffusivity coefficients
at each level. Obviously this program will grow as we develop CVMix, but it
seems like a good starting point.

Directory structure:

bld/ -- Contains the Makefile, is also where the build process will store .o
        and .mod files.

doc/ -- Contains documentation. At this point, it only has a PDF of the latest
        protex in-code notes.

exe/ -- Where the Makefile will put the vmix executable, also contains two
        namelists that can be used to recreate Fig. 3.1 in Steve's notes.

src/ -- Contains the source code. Right now it just contains the driver and
        the subdirectory shared/, which is all the modules that are needed
        to use CVMix with an outside model. (At some point, src/shared/ will
        be picked up as an svn:external for POP and, I assume, MPAS and MOM.

ncl/ -- Will eventually contain NCL scripts for making various plots depending
        on the namelist settings. At this point, it contains one script for
        generating the comparison of two Bryan-Lewis parameter sets. To use
        right now, you need to run 

        exe/] $ vmix < low_lat.ncl > diff1.txt
        exe/] $ vmix < high_lat.ncl > diff2.txt
        ncl/] $ ncl make_diff_plot-BryanLewis.ncl

reg_tests/ -- This is a place-holder, but at some point we will want to create
              a suite of regression tests to ensure everything in CVMix is
              functioning correctly.

INSTALLATION NOTES:

The bld directory contains a Makefile and a 'setup' utility. bld/setup is a
python script that asks for compiler / netcdf information (it only needs to
be run once, info is saved in bld/.CVMix_env). If you just run 'make' without
.CVMix_env, then setup will run automatically.

To build with netcdf, run 'make netcdf' instead of just 'make'.
