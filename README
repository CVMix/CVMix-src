Right now, the stand-alone driver isn't very powerful. It is set up to run
Bryan-Lewis mixing on a single column, and output the diffusivity coefficients
at each level. Obviously this program will grow as we develop CVMix, but it
seems like a good starting point.

Directory structure:

bld/ -- Contains the Makefile, is also where the build process will keep a
        couple of setup files to help with the build. It has two subdirectories:
  bld/obj -- Where .o  and .mod files are stored.
  bld/exe -- Where the Makefile will put the executable.

doc/ -- Contains documentation. At this point, it only has a PDF of the latest
        protex in-code notes.

src/ -- Contains the source code, organized as follows. The top directory
        contains modules needed by the stand-alone driver (output, for example).
  src/drivers -- Stand-alone drivers for different tests.
  src/shared  -- Where all the modules that are needed to use CVMix with an 
                 outside model are stored. (Use as an svn:external!)

reg_tests/ -- I envision this becoming a way to do regression tests as we
              develop the code, but for now all it contains is one test that
              outputs the resulting diffusivity coefficients when using
              Bryan-Lewis mixing on two columns (with each column having its
              own Bryan-Lewis parameterization) and a script to compare the
              output.

              reg_tests/Bryan-Lewis]$ ./pointer_test.sh
                                  (or ./memcopy_test.sh)
              reg_tests/Bryan-Lewis]$ ncl plot_diff_coeffs.ncl

              I'm tempted to put a Makefile in each subdirectory of reg_tests
              to handle output options / select between possible drivers. Then
              the Bryan-Lewis test could be run with one of the following

              reg_tests/Bryan-Lewis]$ make pointer
              reg_tests/Bryan-Lewis]$ make memcopy
              reg_tests/Bryan-Lewis]$ make pointer-netcdf
              reg_tests/Bryan-Lewis]$ make memcopy-netcdf

              One benefit of this is to allow multiple executables to exist
              simultaneously, while also making it easy to clean un-wanted
              executables. It would also reduce the number of scripts in each
              reg_tests/ subdirectory, since all the tests could be launched
              from a single makefile.

INSTALLATION NOTES:

The bld directory contains a Makefile and a 'setup' utility. bld/setup is a
python script that asks for compiler / netcdf information (it only needs to
be run once, info is saved in bld/.CVMix_env). If you just run 'make' without
.CVMix_env, then setup will run automatically. The makefile does require one
variable as input: you need to specify which driver to build. If you omit this
field, you will see an error like

ERROR: You must compile using 'make VMIX_DRIVER=[driver]'. Valid choices are:
vmix_BL_driver-mem_copy.F90
vmix_BL_driver-pointers.F90

To build with netcdf, run 'make VMIX_DRIVER=[] netcdf'.

The default executable is $CVMix/bld/exe/cvmix, but it can be overwritten with
'make EXE=[executable]'.
