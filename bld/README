To build, run

$ make

If this is your first time building, you will be prompted for some basic setup (compiler, location of netcdf). These values are saved in the file CVMix_env if they need to be editted later, or you can run

$ ./setup

To run with netCDF support, use

$ make netcdf

or

$ make USE_NETCDF=[any non-empty string]
