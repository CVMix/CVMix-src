To build, run

$ make VMIX_DRIVER=[specify driver F90 file to use, with no directory information]

If this is your first time building, you will be prompted for some basic setup (compiler, location of netcdf). These values are saved in the file CVMix_env if they need to be editted later, or you can run

$ ./setup

To run with netCDF support, use

$ make VMIX_DRIVER=[driver] netcdf

or

$ make VMIX_DRIVER=[driver] USE_NETCDF=[any non-empty string]
